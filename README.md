# Full-Stack CRUD Demo Project

This Project serves as the front-end for my RESTful API Demo in Spring Boot (https://github.com/ryankline122/RestAPI-demo). Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete entries in a database of "People" objects.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Additional Notes

Make sure the API is running and is connected to the Postgres DB. See the API repo for specific instructions
